Express Node.js back-end message board website demonstrates CRUD-based operations where users can sign up, log in, make posts to be displayed in a chat board and delete posts if they are registered as an admin user.
Posts are saved into MongoDb, and processed with Mongoose. Log-in authentication is handled through passport and bcryptJS to hash & salt passwords to keep them secret and private. Log-in session is handled by express-session. This project follows a Router/Controller/Model structure with PUG as the HTML view engine.
